# Fake-News-Detection
The Fake News Detection project presented in this Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to classify news articles as either fake or real using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It begins with loading and exploring a labeled dataset containing news content and corresponding labels. The text data is then preprocessed and transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. Multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier, are trained and evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrices. The notebook also includes visualizations for better understanding of model performance. Additionally, it offers functionality for users to input custom news text and receive predictions in real-time. Developed in Python, the project leverages libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. To run the notebook, users should ensure these dependencies are installed and execute the cells in sequence. This project serves as a practical application of machine learning and NLP for binary text classification tasks in the domain of misinformation detection.
